/**
 * Exercise: 13.
 * <p>
 * The infamous Mongolian puzzle-warrior Vidrach Itky Leda invented the
 * following puzzle in the year 1473. The puzzle consists of an N x N grid
 * of squares, where each square is labeled with a positive integer, and two
 * tokens, one red and the other blue. The tokens always lie on distinct squares
 * of the grid. The tokens start in the top left and bottom right corners of the
 * grid; the goal of the puzzle is to swap the tokens.
 * In a single turn, you may move either token up, right, down, or left by a
 * distance determined by the other token. For example, if the red token is on a
 * square labeled 3, then you may move the blue token 3 steps up, 3 steps left,
 * 3 steps right, or 3 steps down. However, you may not move either token off
 * the grid, and at the end of a move the two tokens cannot lie on the same
 * square.
 * Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that either returns the
 * minimum number of moves required to solve a given Vidrach Itky Leda
 * puzzle, or correctly reports that the puzzle has no solution. For example,
 * given the puzzle in Figure 5.16, your algorithm would return the number 5.
